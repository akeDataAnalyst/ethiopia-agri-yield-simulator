# Ethiopia Agricultural Yield Simulator & Insights Dashboard

**Interactive Streamlit app + Portfolio Project**  

## Project Overview

This repository contains an **interactive web dashboard** built with Streamlit that simulates interventions to improve agricultural productivity in Ethiopia. It is part of my portfolio project demonstrating data analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic insight generation.

The project uses synthetic but realistic data representing Ethiopian agriculture (2000–2023) across 8 regions and 5 major crops (Teff, Wheat, Maize, Barley, Sorghum). It addresses real challenges: climate disparities, low input adoption, stagnant yields, and regional inequalities.

### Key Features
- **Yield Prediction Simulator** — Adjust rainfall (irrigation), fertilizer use, and market access → instantly see predicted yield uplift
- **Economic Impact Calculator** — Estimates extra production, added value (USD), and ROI for targeted interventions
- **EDA Insights Tab** — Visualizes national trends, regional yield gaps, and correlations from Phase 2 analysis
- **Model Insights Tab** — Shows regression coefficients, R² (0.71), RMSE, and full-package scenario results (+54% uplift, 175% ROI)

### Project Phases
1. **Data Generation** — Realistic synthetic dataset with region-specific climate and input ranges
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Identified climate-driven gaps (Afar/Tigray ~30–55% below national avg)
3. **Predictive Modeling** — Linear regression (R² = 0.7137) quantifying drivers of yield
4. **Scenario Simulation** — What-if analysis for vulnerable regions
5. **Interactive Dashboard** — Deployed Streamlit app for stakeholder exploration
